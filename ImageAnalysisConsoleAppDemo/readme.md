This demo calls the Cognitive Services Computer Vision Image Analysis API from a .NET console application.

I wrote it as a demo of how to pass a binary image to a web service and this was the simplest example I could conceive.

To use it, you will need to:

1. Create a new Azure Cognitive Services Computer Vision service
2. Add an App.config file to the app and add the key to this file.
3. Save an image named "kittens.jpg" in c:\test.
